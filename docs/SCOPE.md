Version: 1.0  
Owner: Shreya  
Date: 09/11/2025

## 1. Scope Overview
The HabitLite project will deliver a simple habit-tracking MVP focused on daily habit logging, weekly progress visibility, and basic data export.  
Scope includes requirements gathering, UI design, development, testing, documentation, and release.

## 2. Functional Requirements
### Must Have (MVP)
- Add new habits  
- Edit habits  
- Delete habits  
- Mark habit completed for each day  
- Store habit history in LocalStorage  
- Weekly summary view  
- Export habit history to CSV  

### Should Have
- Light/dark mode toggle  

### Could Have
- Weekly heatmap view for habits  

### Will NOT Have
- User authentication  
- Cloud sync or database integration  
- Notifications or reminders  
- Multi-user account support  
- Paid features or premium mode  

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements
- Mobile-friendly responsive design  
- Loads in under 2 seconds  
- Minimal and clean UI  
- Works offline (LocalStorage based)  

## 4. Deliverables
- Requirements document  
- Wireframes & user flow diagrams  
- WBS  
- Gantt chart  
- RACI matrix  
- Communication plan  
- Risk register  
- Issue log  
- UAT test cases  
- Release plan  
- Lessons learned  
- Final prototype / MVP  

## 5. Constraints
- One-person team  
- Must use only free tools  
- No backend allowed  

## 6. Assumptions
- Users will access the app via browser  
- Data will be stored locally only  
- Beta users have basic familiarity with web apps  

## 7. Acceptance Criteria
- All “Must Have” features implemented and tested  
- CSV file downloads correctly  
- Weekly summary calculations are accurate  
- No high-severity bugs at release  

## 8. Out-of-Scope Justification
Cloud sync, scheduling, and push notifications require backend servers and paid services.  
These are explicitly excluded to maintain MVP simplicity and free-tool limitations.
