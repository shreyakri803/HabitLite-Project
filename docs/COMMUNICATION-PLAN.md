Version: 1.0  
Owner: Shreya  
Date: 09/11/2025

## 1. Purpose
This plan defines how information will be communicated, documented, and shared throughout the HabitLite project.  
Clear communication ensures alignment, visibility, and accountability across all phases of the project.

## 2. Communication Objectives
- Provide consistent project visibility
- Track progress against milestones
- Ensure timely escalation of risks and issues
- Maintain transparent documentation for review

## 3. Communication Methods

### A. Project Status Reporting
**Type:** Weekly Status Report  
**Format:** PDF/PNG uploaded to `/status-reports` folder  
**Frequency:** Weekly (simulated timeline)  
**Owner:** Project Manager  
**Includes:**  
- RAG status  
- Achievements  
- Next steps  
- Issues  
- Risks  

### B. Daily Task Updates
**Type:** Micro-updates  
**Method:** Trello Board / GitHub Issues  
**Frequency:** Daily (simulated)  
**Owner:** Shreya  
**Details:**  
All task progress, comments, and blockers logged in Trello and GitHub Issues.

### C. Design & Planning Communication
**Type:** Diagram uploads  
**Method:** `/designs` folder in GitHub  
**Frequency:** As needed  
**Owner:** PM  
**Details:** Beta users provide feedback which is recorded in the Issue Log.

## 4. Stakeholder Communication Matrix
| Stakeholder | Information Needed | Format | Frequency |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|-----------|
| Project Manager (Self) | Status, issues, risks, changes | Docs / Trello / GitHub | Daily |
| Beta Users | Test instructions, links, updates | Email / Form | Testing Phase |
| Reviewers (Interviewers/Recruiters) | Project documentation | GitHub Repository | Once, at project end |

## 5. Document Storage & Version Control
All project artifacts are stored in GitHub under appropriate folders:  
- `/docs` – PM documents & templates  
- `/designs` – diagrams, screenshots, UI sketches  
- `/issues-log` – issue tracking  
- `/status-reports` – weekly reports  

Repository serves as the single source of truth.

## 6. Escalation Guidelines (Simulated)
- Issues blocking core functionality → escalate to PM (self) within 1 day  
- High-severity bugs → immediate fix during testing  
- Scope change → evaluated and documented in Change Request Form

## 7. Tools Used
- Trello (Kanban board)  
- Draw.io (User flow, wireframes)  
- Google Sheets/Docs (Logs, reports)  
- GitHub (Documentation, final archive)
