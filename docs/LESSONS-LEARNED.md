# Lessons Learned – HabitLite  
Version: 1.0  
Owner: Shreya  
Completion Date: 2025-11-09 

## 1. Project Overview
The HabitLite project aimed to deliver a clean and minimal habit-tracking MVP with a structured project management approach.  
The project followed a complete lifecycle including initiation, planning, execution, testing, release, and closure.

## 2. What Went Well
### ✅ Clear Scope Definition
Early identification of the MVP scope helped keep the workload controlled and prevented unnecessary expansion.

### ✅ Smooth Execution of Core Features
Key functionalities such as habit creation, editing, daily tracking, and CSV export were completed according to the plan.

### ✅ Effective Risk & Issue Tracking
Risks and issues were logged early, monitored, and resolved systematically.  
This reduced rework and improved project flow.

### ✅ Well-Maintained Documentation
All planning and execution documents were created and version-controlled:
- Project charter  
- Scope  
- WBS  
- Gantt chart  
- RACI  
- Risk register  
- UAT  
- Release plan  

This enabled clear traceability throughout the project.

## 3. What Didn’t Go Well
### ⚠️ Weekly Summary Logic Required Extra Time
The streak calculation and weekly aggregation were more complex than expected, requiring multiple rounds of testing.

### ⚠️ UI Responsiveness Gaps
Initial mobile layout had spacing and alignment issues that needed redesign.

### ⚠️ CSV Export Edge Cases
When no habits existed, the CSV export function threw errors; this required additional fallback logic.

## 4. Key Issues Faced
- I1: Weekly summary miscalculating streaks  
- I2: CSV export failing on empty data  
- I3: Mobile UI misalignment  

All major issues were resolved before release.

## 5. Improvement Recommendations
### ✅ Begin Testing Earlier
Starting testing during development would help detect issues sooner.

### ✅ Break Down Tasks More Granularly
Smaller subtasks would improve visibility and reduce overwhelm.

### ✅ Mid-Phase Review
A checkpoint mid-phase would catch logic gaps earlier.

### ✅ Maintain Consistent UI Patterns
Consistent fonts, spacing, and button design reduce UI-related rework.

## 6. Final Takeaways
- Clear scope and structured planning create predictable delivery  
- Regularly updated logs improve control over risks and issues  
- User interface requires early and frequent validation  
- Even simple tools can support complete project management workflows  

## 7. Closure Statement
The HabitLite MVP has fulfilled all planned objectives and met the defined success criteria.  
The project is formally closed as of **09-11-2025**, with all documentation archived in the repository.
